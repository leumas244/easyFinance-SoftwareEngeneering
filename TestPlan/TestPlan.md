# Test plan

## 1.	Introduction
### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. 
It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan supports the following objectives:
-	Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-	Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-	Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
-	Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2	Scope
This document describes the used unit test.

### 1.3	Intended Audience
This document is meant for internal use primarily.

### 1.4	Document Terminology and Acronyms
- **SRS**	Software Requirements Specification
- **n/a**	not applicable
- **tbd**	to be determined
